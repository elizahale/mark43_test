This server is designed using Flask and Python.

You should be able to run it by installing Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/ and Python. (*update - I believe that all necessary flask files are already included in this repository - so installing flask may not be necessary.)

Once Flask and Python are installed, you should be able to run the server by navigating into this folder in the terminal (works in Unix) and running ./run.py.

Then, you can go to http://localhost:5000/words/avg_len
http://localhost:5000/words/median
or
http://localhost:5000/words/most_com

To get information about the text!

I realize that I am not returning a JSON file, as specified in the instructions of the text.  In the spirit of the test, I focused more on getting some endpoints working, and not going down rabbit holes.  I have not set up any sort of server before, and very much enjoyed working on this!  Thank you again!
